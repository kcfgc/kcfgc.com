It's Tuesday once more, and with it comes another night of gaming. As always, in addition to the brackets posted below, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out!

**ALSO** we will have a **MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM EXTREME VS. MAXIBOOST ON** setup this night, coordinated by Fox-Shot. Come on out and join us for some 2v2 mech action in what is almost certainly the most active MBON scene in the region.

## Fee and Schedule
$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. 

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **UNICLR** (toad_slayer) - 8pm, $0 entry
- **SG2E** (golbat) - 8:30pm, $0 entry 
- **MBON** (Fox-Shot) - all night!

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social
