Let's run it back! We're back at [Larry's Game Store](https://www.larrysgamestore.com/) for some good old fashioned anime fun! Brackets will be run for a rotating selection of games every other Saturday night, and casuals are welcome for any game all night. Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able! 

## Fee and Schedule
$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**.

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **Guilty Gear Strive** - 8pm, $5 entry fee (payout for top 3)
- **Soul Calibur VI** - 8:30pm, Free entry
- **Fate/unlimited Codes** - 9:00pm, Free entry
