## Welcome to the Magic Pixel Weekly! 

It's the last Tuesday of the month, which means it's all community-organized games! There will be free brackets and casuals only.

MBON (Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. Maxiboost ON) will be happening this night, come check it out if you haven't yet!

Each week a minimum of 4 setups worth of space will be reserved for casual play and side brackets. This space can be reserved by anyone wanting to organize another game, please join us on  [discord](https://discord.gg/jkmn6CVrrQ) if you'd like to do so! Community-organized events will be posted here as they're confirmed.

Keep an eye on our [start.gg hub](https://www.start.gg/hub/magic-pixel) for future events, and [kcmagicpixel.com](https://kcmagicpixel.com) for more of what's going on in the KC scene!

### Entry

$5 venue fee, collected by the TO.  
Drinks and snacks available for purchase.
