      Kansas City's SoulCalibur tournaments follow the community standard
      ruleset.


      Preliminary matches are best of three, while finals are best of five.


      Any player pausing the game forfeits their current round (or their next round if they are not a participant in the current match).


      During the first match of a set, players select their characters and the stage is selected at random.  After a match, the winner is "locked" into their character.  They are not permitted to switch their character until (and unless) they lose a subsequent match.  All matches within a set are loser's choice, with no cap on a particular option.


      Loser's Choice Options:

      1. Rematch with the current characters and stage.

      2. Rematch with the current characters and a new random stage.

      3. Return to character select to choose a new character and new random stage.


      Inferno and custom characters cannot be selected (even randomly).


      Input sequence macros are banned.


      All other gameplay is legal.


      Our brackets' rules mirror those defined here:
