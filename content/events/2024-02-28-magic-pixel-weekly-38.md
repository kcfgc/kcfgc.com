February has come and gone already, but week after week we've been out here gaming. This week is no exception; we've got **VSAV**, **MBTL**, and **GBVSR** on deck. Come out and get some games!

As always, in addition to the brackets posted below, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out! We've had a huge number of people out for Tekken 8 casuals this month, so if that's what you're trying to play, you'll find games!

## Fee and Schedule

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **VSAV** (Enker) - 8:00pm, $0 entry
- **MBTL** (cavitae) - 8:30pm, $0 entry
- **GBVSR** (Bimmy) - 9:00pm, $0 entry

$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. 

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social
Come check out the [discord](https://discord.gg/jkmn6CVrrQ) to be a part of the future of the Magic Pixel Weekly, and get in on our Sunday night casuals event. Keep an eye on our [start.gg hub](https://www.start.gg/hub/magic-pixel) for future events too, as well as [kcmagicpixel.com](https://kcmagicpixel.com) for more of what's going on in the KC scene!

## About Us

Magic Pixel is a collective of fighting game players committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming place to play for everyone. Our events are run for the community, by the community, and our priority will always be to cultivate an environment where the games played each week are the games the community wants to play.
