## Fee and Schedule

Venue fee: $10 paid on arrival. The venue fee is paid to Larry's Game Store directly, either in-person while the shop is open, or on the [LGS website](https://www.larrysgamestore.com/products/kc-magic-pixel-5) after hours. 

* Doors open at 4pm
* Under Night (PS4) 4:30PM
* Street Fighter 6 (PS5) 5:00PM

We will be playing in the shop's event space, which is two doors to the left of the shop itself. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. The event schedule is detailed in the Events section of the sidebar, and is also always listed on the [Magic Pixel Events](https://kcmagicpixel.com/events/) page.

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!
