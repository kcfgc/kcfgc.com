It's the last Magic Pixel event of 2023*, and we've got a wonderful winter night of gaming planned to see it off with! We have a very special **Vampire Savior** bracket this evening, as well our very first ever **Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising** tournament!! (\*if Larry's is open Dec 26th, we _may_ be hosting a casuals-only night. We'll post about it in the usual places if it's happening)

Thank you all for such a wonderful year! It takes every single person coming out to these events to make them what they are, so whether you've helped run brackets, brought your setup, or simply just shown up to play some games, I am so incredibly grateful for you to have been a part of it. Magic Pixel has grown into something special in 2023, a group that is truly run by the community, for the community, and I can't wait for what 2024 has in store for us.

<!-- As always, in addition to the brackets posted below, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out! --> 

## Fee and Schedule
$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. 

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **GBVSR** (Bimmy) - 8:00pm, $0 entry, PS5 controller/adapter required!
- **VSAV** (Enker) - 8:30pm, $0 entry

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!
