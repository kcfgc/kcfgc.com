Welcome back to the Magic Pixel weekly! On deck for bracket we have **Melty Blood: Type Lumina**, **Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes**, and **Skullgirls: 2nd Encore**. Additionally, we'll have space set aside for a **Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. Maxi Boost ON** setup, so if 2v2 arcade action sounds up your alley, swing on by and try it out!

As always, in addition to the brackets posted below, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out! We've had a huge number of people out for Tekken 8 casuals this month, so if that's what you're trying to play, you'll find games!

## Fee and Schedule

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with a TO on arrival (in parentheses below)
- **MBTL** (cavitae) - 8:00pm, $0 entry
- **UNI2** (Loafer) - 8:30pm, $0 entry
- **SG2E** (Golbat) - 9:00pm, $0 entry

$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. 

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!
