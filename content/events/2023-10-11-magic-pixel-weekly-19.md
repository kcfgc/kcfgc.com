Welcome back to another Tuesday night local! We're excited to be implementing our brand new organizational structure, under which individual [Game Captains](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wtEAvkOOeXrrJ6O-5C3Sem3D4pmhqPIl5g4WeeYQPBU/edit) will be running brackets for their specific games going forward. We've had an incredible number of people sign up to run 10 different games in October alone, so please give them a special thanks when you come out!

In addition to MK1 and UNICLR tonight, we'll also have a Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. Maxi Boost ON setup available all night for folks to rotate through, some come get in on some 2v2 mech action!

## Fee and Schedule
$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**.

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **MK1** (httpriestess) - 8pm, $0 entry 
- **UNICLR** (toad_slayer) - 8:30pm, $0 entry
- **MBON** (Fox-Shot) - All night!

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social
