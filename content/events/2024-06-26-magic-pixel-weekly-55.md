The end of June is already here, and the fourth Tuesday of the month means we'll be out at Larry's running **TEKKEN 8**, **SG2E**, and **UNI2**. If you're looking for some sweaty sets, there's no better time to get 'em.

For the month of June, we’re going to trial running Tekken World Tour Dojo events, which means that for any brackets with 16 entrants or more, you’ll be eligible to receive TWT points depending on your placement. If everything goes smoothly this month, we plan to continue doing this throughout the TWT season, so now’s the perfect time to join in! Check out [tekkenworldtour.com](tekkenworldtour.com) to find out how to register for the tour and link your start.gg account.

As always, in addition to the brackets listed, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out! 

## Fee and Schedule

Doors open at 7pm, please pay your $5 venue fee on arrival. The venue fee is paid to Larry's Game Store directly, either in-person while the shop is open, or on the [LGS website](https://www.larrysgamestore.com/products/kc-magic-pixel-5) after hours. This is what allows us to continue using the space, so please make sure you've paid before you leave!

We will be playing in the shop's event space, which is two doors to the left of the shop itself. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. The event schedule is detailed in the Events section of the sidebar, and is also always listed on the [Magic Pixel Events](https://kcmagicpixel.com/events/) page.

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social

Come check out the [discord](https://discord.gg/jkmn6CVrrQ) to be a part of the future of the Magic Pixel Weekly, and get in on our Sunday night casuals event. Keep an eye on our [start.gg hub](https://www.start.gg/hub/magic-pixel) for future events too, as well as [kcmagicpixel.com](https://kcmagicpixel.com) for more of what's going on in the KC scene!
