We're back again for the 18th Tuesday night local! This week marks our last weekly under the current event structure. Moving forward, all brackets will be run by Game Captains, who are passionate about a specific game and about making it happen on a regular basis! The specifics have been written up in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wtEAvkOOeXrrJ6O-5C3Sem3D4pmhqPIl5g4WeeYQPBU/edit), if you have any questions or you're interested in joining the team, please join us in Discord!

## Fee and Schedule
$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**.

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **SF6** - 8pm, $5 entry fee (payout for top 3)
- **MBTL** - 9pm, Free entry 

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!
