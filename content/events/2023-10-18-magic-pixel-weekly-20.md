Welcome to our 20th ever weekly event under the Magic Pixel banner! We're excited to be implementing our brand new organizational structure, under which individual [Game Captains](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wtEAvkOOeXrrJ6O-5C3Sem3D4pmhqPIl5g4WeeYQPBU/edit) will be running brackets for their specific games going forward. We've had an incredible number of people sign up to run 10 different games in October alone, so please give them a special thanks when you come out! In addition to the brackets posted below, casuals are welcome for any game all night, as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out!

## Fee and Schedule
$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**.

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **MBTL** (cavitae) - 8pm, $0 entry 
- **TEKKEN 7** (Mob) - 8:30pm, $0 entry
- **SF6** (Enker) - 9pm, $5 entry (payout for top 3)

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social

## About Us

Magic Pixel is a collective of fighting game players committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming place to play for everyone. Our events are run for the community, by the community, and our priority will always be to cultivate an environment where the games played each week are the games the community wants to play.
