Welcome for shopping with us at another Tuesday local! Brackets will be run for a rotating selection of games every Tuesday night, and casuals are welcome for any game all night. Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!
