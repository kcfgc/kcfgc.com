Welcome to the last Magic Pixel Runback of 2023! We'll be sending it off with Strive, SamSho, and SCVI brackets, in addition to whatever y'all bring! After this (and the following [Tuesday](https://kcmagicpixel.com/)), we'll be taking a short break for the holidays, but we'll be running it back on Saturdays again in early 2024. As always, in addition to the brackets posted below, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out!

## Fee and Schedule
$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. 

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **GGST** (Gaypom) - 8pm, $5 entry
- **SAMSHO** (Chrono Sanaki) - 8:30pm, $0 entry 
- **SCVI** (Chibitanner) - 9pm, $0 entry

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!  

## Social
