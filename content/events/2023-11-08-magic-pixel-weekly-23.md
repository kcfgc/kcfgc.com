November's here, so bundle up and get back out here for another weekly! We've got an even more packed lineup of games this month, so check the links below to find out what's going down. Additionally, we're planning on having a Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. Maxiboost On setup, so show up tonight to get in on the 2v2, 4-playstation action!

In addition to the brackets posted below, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out!

## Fee and Schedule
$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**.

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **GGST** (lunatec) - 8pm, $5 entry 
- **BBCF** (Ellen) - 8:30pm, $0 entry

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!
