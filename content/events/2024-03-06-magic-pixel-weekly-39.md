Welcome to the first weekly of March! We've got a ton of games planned this month, and we're kicking it off with Melty, Strive, and SamSho. See you there!

As always, in addition to the brackets posted below, casuals are welcome for any game all night as long as setups are available, so please bring your favorite game out! We've had a huge number of people out for Tekken 8 casuals this month, so if that's what you're trying to play, you'll find games!

## Fee and Schedule

- **Doors open** - 7pm, please pay your venue fee and check in with the TO on arrival
- **MBTL** (cavitae) - 8:00pm, $0 entry
- **SAMSHO** (Chrono Sanaki) - 8:30pm, $0 entry
- **GGST** (Lunatec) - 9:00pm, $5 entry

$5 venue fee, collected by the shop staff. Game entry fees are collected by the TO, and are **CASH ONLY**. 

Participants must bring their own controller and any necessary adapter, though we do have a limited number of community PS4 controllers and Brook PS5 adapters available. We rely on all of you to be able to run our brackets, so please bring your setup out (a playstation with the game + all character DLC + a monitor) if you are able!

## About Us

Magic Pixel is a collective of fighting game players committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming place to play for everyone. Our events are run for the community, by the community, and our priority will always be to cultivate an environment where the games played each week are the games the community wants to play.
